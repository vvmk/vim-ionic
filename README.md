# ionic.vim

## 7/26/18: ionic 4 dropped sooner than I expected, I may not have any use for this. just use whatever plugins you like for the framework you're using. (maybe it will be worth the time if ionic/typescript/web components is cool...plus no other frameworks)

currently under development

This plugin is heavily influenced/inspired by both [vim-rails](https://github.com/tpope/vim-rails) by tpope and [angular-cli.vim](https://github.com/bdauria/angular-cli.vim) by bdauria.
